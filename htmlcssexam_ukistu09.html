    <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.<br>. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one<br> to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people<br> rather than goods.[2][3]</p>

<div>Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies<br> depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when<br> German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[1][4][5] Cars<br> became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible<br> to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.<br> Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[6] In Europe<br> and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6]</div>

<div>Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights.<br> Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added<br> to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing<br> cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars<br> in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the <br>combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became<br> commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before<br> 2025.[7][8] The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate <br>change mitigation scenarios,[9] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[10]</div>

<div>Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, <br>and convenience.[13] Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as<br> job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision,<br> societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from <br>taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications<br> for the nature of societies.[14] There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage<br>. is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.[15]
